### üöÄ Some of my projects
In my repositories you can find <strong>some of my projects</strong>, made over the years, such as:
- [Steganography (2021)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Steganography): apply steganography theory on images, using multithread, to hide a message between two interlocutors;
- [Cinema's tickets booking system (2021)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Progetto-F21): a whole application in order to book cinema tickets, applying software engineering theory (UMLs, GoF patterns, GRASP, ...); 
- [Gas Consumption Prediction (2021)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Gas_consumption-prediction): a project whose aim is predict gas consumption in Italy, given some parameters, using model identification theory and data analysis;
- [Autonomous Car Drive (2019)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Autonomous-Car-Drive): an <em>"Arduino Car"</em> that drives alone, using its optical sensors and some Python code to detect other cars and pedestrians in a real situation, via video analysis;
- [Selector Guide (2016)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Selector-Guide): an app to help [Via Technologies](https://www.viatech.com/en/) vendors to sell Via's products to customers, once they've specified product's features;
- [Face Detection (2021)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Face-Detection), [Games (2016-2018)](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/Games), and so on.
